## Overview

How the `learn` skill works, step by step.

> this is a human-readable map of what it does and how it runs.

## What it does & when to use

Manage project learnings. Review, search, prune, and export what gstack has learned across sessions. Use when asked to "what have we learned", "show learnings", "prune stale learnings", or "export learnings". Proactively suggest when the user asks about past patterns or wonders "didn't we fix this before?"

## Triggers

- `what have we learned`
- `show learnings`
- `prune stale learnings`
- `export learnings`
- `didn`

## How it works

Workflow outline (sections of `SKILL.md`):

1. Preamble (run first)
2. Plan Mode Safe Operations
3. Skill Invocation During Plan Mode
4. Skill routing
5. AskUserQuestion Format
6. Artifacts Sync (skill start)
7. Model-Specific Behavioral Patch (claude)
8. Voice
9. Context Recovery
10. Writing Style (skip entirely if EXPLAIN_LEVEL: terse appears in the preamble echo OR the user's current message explicitly requests terse / no-explanations output)
11. Completeness Principle — Boil the Lake
12. Confusion Protocol
13. Continuous Checkpoint Mode
14. Context Health (soft directive)
15. Question Tuning (skip entirely if QUESTION_TUNING: false)
16. Completion Status Protocol
17. Operational Self-Improvement
18. Telemetry (run last)
19. Plan Status Footer
20. Detect command
21. Show recent (default)
22. Search
23. Prune
24. Export
25. Project Learnings
26. Stats
27. Manual add

## Components

Single-file skill — all instructions live in `SKILL.md`.

## Invoke

- Slash: `/learn`
- Or a natural-language request matching the triggers above.

---
_Source: `SKILL.md` in this directory._

## Execution Logic

The skill executes when its trigger fires (slash command, natural-language match, or direct invocation). It reads its references, applies its rules, and produces the documented outputs.

## Edge Cases

See the source skill's `references/` and `scripts/` folders for edge-case handling.

## Failure Handling

A skill failure surfaces as a tool error or a partial output; never a silent skip. Re-run with `--verbose` (where applicable) for diagnostics.

## Integration Notes

- Claude — invoked via the `Skill` tool with `skill: "learn"`.
- Codex — referenced from `AGENTS.md` if mirrored.
- Antigravity — referenced from the workspace agent rules if mirrored.
- HQ Project — listed on the landing page Skills section + post-login sidebar.
- MD Project (md.sgnk.ai) — file rendered from `Skills/Learn/workflow.md`.
- Obsidian — file rendered with frontmatter + tags.

## Usage Examples

Invoke via slash command or natural language matching the skill description.
