## What it does & when to use

Systematically QA test a web application and fix bugs found. Runs QA testing, then iteratively fixes bugs in source code, committing each fix atomically and re-verifying. Use when asked to "qa", "QA", "test this site", "find bugs", "test and fix", or "fix what's broken". Proactively suggest when the user says a feature is ready for testing or asks "does this work?". Three tiers: Quick (critical/high only), Standard (+ medium), Exhaustive (+ cosmetic). Produces before/after health scores, fix evidence, and a ship-readiness summary. For report-only mode, use /qa-only. (gstack) Voice triggers (speech-to-text aliases): "quality check", "test the app", "run QA".

## Triggers

- `test this site`
- `find bugs`
- `test and fix`
- `fix what`
- `does this work?`
- `quality check`
- `test the app`
- `run QA`

## How it works

Workflow outline (sections of `SKILL.md`):

1. Preamble (run first)
2. Plan Mode Safe Operations
3. Skill Invocation During Plan Mode
4. Skill routing
5. AskUserQuestion Format
6. Artifacts Sync (skill start)
7. Model-Specific Behavioral Patch (claude)
8. Voice
9. Context Recovery
10. Writing Style (skip entirely if EXPLAIN_LEVEL: terse appears in the preamble echo OR the user's current message explicitly requests terse / no-explanations output)
11. Completeness Principle — Boil the Lake
12. Confusion Protocol
13. Continuous Checkpoint Mode
14. Context Health (soft directive)
15. Question Tuning (skip entirely if QUESTION_TUNING: false)
16. Repo Ownership — See Something, Say Something
17. Search Before Building
18. Completion Status Protocol
19. Operational Self-Improvement
20. Telemetry (run last)
21. Plan Status Footer
22. Step 0: Detect platform and base branch
23. Setup
24. SETUP (run this check BEFORE any browse command)
25. Test Framework Bootstrap
26. Prior Learnings
27. Test Plan Context
28. Phases 1-6: QA Baseline
29. Modes
30. Workflow
31. Health Score Rubric
32. Framework-Specific Guidance
33. Important Rules
34. Output Structure
35. Phase 7: Triage
36. Phase 8: Fix Loop
37. Phase 9: Final QA
38. Phase 10: Report
39. Phase 11: TODOS.md Update
40. Capture Learnings
41. Additional Rules (qa-specific)

## Components

Single-file skill — all instructions live in `SKILL.md`.

## Invoke

- Slash: `/qa`
- Or a natural-language request matching the triggers above.

---
_Source: `SKILL.md` in this directory._

## Execution Logic

The skill executes when its trigger fires (slash command, natural-language match, or direct invocation). It reads its references, applies its rules, and produces the documented outputs.

## Edge Cases

See the source skill's `references/` and `scripts/` folders for edge-case handling.

## Failure Handling

A skill failure surfaces as a tool error or a partial output; never a silent skip. Re-run with `--verbose` (where applicable) for diagnostics.

## Integration Notes

- Claude — invoked via the `Skill` tool with `skill: "qa"`.
- Codex — referenced from `AGENTS.md` if mirrored.
- Antigravity — referenced from the workspace agent rules if mirrored.
- HQ Project — listed on the landing page Skills section + post-login sidebar.
- MD Project (md.sgnk.ai) — file rendered from `Skills/Qa/workflow.md`.
- Obsidian — file rendered with frontmatter + tags.

## Usage Examples

Invoke via slash command or natural language matching the skill description.
