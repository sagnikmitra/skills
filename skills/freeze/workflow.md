## What it does & when to use

Restrict file edits to a specific directory for the session. Blocks Edit and Write outside the allowed path. Use when debugging to prevent accidentally "fixing" unrelated code, or when you want to scope changes to one module. Use when asked to "freeze", "restrict edits", "only edit this folder", or "lock down edits". (gstack)

## Triggers

- `fixing`
- `freeze`
- `restrict edits`
- `only edit this folder`
- `lock down edits`

## Components

Single-file skill — all instructions live in `SKILL.md`.

## Invoke

- Slash: `/freeze`
- Or a natural-language request matching the triggers above.

---
_Source: `SKILL.md` in this directory._

## Execution Logic

The skill executes when its trigger fires (slash command, natural-language match, or direct invocation). It reads its references, applies its rules, and produces the documented outputs.

## Edge Cases

See the source skill's `references/` and `scripts/` folders for edge-case handling.

## Failure Handling

A skill failure surfaces as a tool error or a partial output; never a silent skip. Re-run with `--verbose` (where applicable) for diagnostics.

## Integration Notes

- Claude — invoked via the `Skill` tool with `skill: "freeze"`.
- Codex — referenced from `AGENTS.md` if mirrored.
- Antigravity — referenced from the workspace agent rules if mirrored.
- HQ Project — listed on the landing page Skills section + post-login sidebar.
- MD Project (md.sgnk.ai) — file rendered from `Skills/Freeze/workflow.md`.
- Obsidian — file rendered with frontmatter + tags.

## Usage Examples

Invoke via slash command or natural language matching the skill description.
