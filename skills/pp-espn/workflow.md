# ESPN — Printing Press CLI

## Prerequisites: Install the CLI

This skill drives the `espn-pp-cli` binary. **You must verify the CLI is installed before invoking any command from this skill.** If it is missing, install it first:

1. Install via the Printing Press installer:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mvanhorn/printing-press install espn --cli-only
   ```
2. Verify: `espn-pp-cli --version`
3. Ensure `$GOPATH/bin` (or `$HOME/go/bin`) is on `$PATH`.

If the `npx` install fails (no Node, offline, etc.), fall back to a direct Go install (requires Go 1.26.3 or newer):

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/espn/cmd/espn-pp-cli@latest
```

If `--version` reports "command not found" after install, the install step did not put the binary on `$PATH`. Do not proceed with skill commands until verification succeeds.

## When to Use This CLI

Reach for this when a user wants a quick sports lookup - current score, standings, upcoming schedule, head-to-head record, or a rich per-game summary (box score, leaders, scoring plays, odds, win probability). Also good for cross-league discovery (`today`) and offline search across synced data.

Don't reach for this if the user has a paid feed like Stats Perform or Sportradar that provides cleaner data, or if they need real-time websocket updates (ESPN's endpoints are polling-only). For betting odds in isolation, the per-game `summary` payload includes them but there is no league-wide odds command.

## Unique Capabilities

Commands that only work because of local sync + cross-league tooling.

### Cross-league discovery

- **`today`** — Today's scores across all major sports in one call. The fastest "what's on tonight" answer without picking a sport first.

- **`trending`** — Most-followed athletes and teams across all leagues, ranked by current popularity. Good for "who is hot right now" without naming a sport.

- **`dashboard`** — Reads `[favorites]` from `~/.config/espn-pp-cli/config.toml` and shows scores for each favorited team across leagues, in one call.

- **`watch <sport> <league> --event <game_id>`** — Live score updates for a specific game (polls every 30s). Use `scores` or `today` to find the game, then `watch` to follow it live.

### Game-state intelligence

- **`summary <sport> <league> --event <game_id>`** — Detailed game summary including box score, leaders, scoring plays, odds, and win probability. The single richest payload per game.

- **`boxscore <event_id>`** — Just the per-player box score for an event id, with sport+league inferred from a recent scoreboard cache hit. Pass `--sport`/`--league` to skip inference.

- **`plays <sport> <league> --event <id>`** — Play-by-play feed for a specific event. Optional `--limit` (default 200).

- **`recap <sport> <league>`** — Post-game recap with box score and leaders for the most recent completed game in a league.

- **`scoreboard <sport> <league>`** — Live scoreboard with date filtering, week/group selectors, and competition metadata.

- **`odds <sport> <league>`** — Spread, over/under, and moneyline lines for tonight's slate, derived from the scoreboard payload (no per-game summary calls).

### Standings and rankings

- **`standings <sport> <league>`** — Conference/division standings.

- **`rankings <sport> <league>`** — Current AP, Coaches, and CFP poll rankings (NCAAF/NCAAM).

- **`streak <sport> <league>`** — Current win/loss streaks across teams in a league, computed from synced data.

- **`rivals <sport> <league>`** — Head-to-head records between teams in a league from synced data.

- **`h2h <team1> <team2> --sport <s> --league <l>`** — Deeper head-to-head detail for one specific pair, including average score and recent meetings list.

- **`sos <sport> <league>`** — Strength-of-schedule per team, derived from the standings payload, sorted descending.

### People

- **`leaders <sport> <league> [--category <name>]`** — Statistical leaders across categories with optional filter.

- **`compare <athlete1> <athlete2> --sport <s> --league <l>`** — Side-by-side season stats for two athletes. Ambiguous names list candidates and exit 2.

- **`injuries <sport> <league>`** — Active injury report across the league, grouped by team.

- **`transactions <sport> <league>`** — Recent trades, signings, and waivers.

### Local store

- **`sync`** — Pull a sport+league dataset into local SQLite for offline analysis.

- **`search "<query>"`** — Full-text search across synced events and news.

- **`sql <query>`** — Run read-only SQL queries against the local database.

## Recipes

### Morning sports scan

```bash
espn-pp-cli today --agent --select events.shortName,events.status
espn-pp-cli scores football nfl --agent --select events.shortName,events.competitions.competitors.team.displayName,events.status.type.detail
espn-pp-cli standings football nfl --agent
```

One `today` call covers cross-league activity, one `scores` for the league you care about, one `standings` for context. The nested `--select` paths cut a scoreboard payload from tens of KB down to the fields that actually matter — essential for keeping agent context small.

### Pre-game research from synced data

```bash
espn-pp-cli sync --sport football --league nfl
espn-pp-cli rivals football nfl --agent         # historical records from synced data
espn-pp-cli streak football nfl --agent         # current streaks
espn-pp-cli summary football nfl --event <id> --agent   # full game payload incl. odds and box score
```

Run `sync` once, then `rivals` and `streak` answer instantly from the local store. `summary` is the richest single payload for a specific game (box score, leaders, scoring plays, odds, win probability).

### Offline search after sync

```bash
espn-pp-cli sync --sport football --league nfl
espn-pp-cli search "Mahomes"                    # finds in local store
```

Useful for repeated lookups in poor-connectivity environments or when batch-analyzing historical data.

### Favorites dashboard

Add a `[favorites]` block to `~/.config/espn-pp-cli/config.toml`:

```
[favorites]
nfl = ["KC", "BAL"]
nba = ["LAL"]
```

Then:

```bash
espn-pp-cli dashboard --agent
```

One call surfaces tonight's matchup status for every favorited team, grouped by league. Per-league fetches run in parallel and partial failures are reported alongside successful results.

### Pre-game odds and player digging

```bash
espn-pp-cli odds basketball nba --agent          # tonight's spreads / totals / moneylines
espn-pp-cli leaders basketball nba --category points --agent
espn-pp-cli compare "LeBron James" "Stephen Curry" --sport basketball --league nba --agent
espn-pp-cli boxscore <event_id> --agent          # post-game player stats
espn-pp-cli plays basketball nba --event <id> --limit 50 --agent
```

`odds` reads the scoreboard's per-event lines (no per-game summary calls). `leaders --category` filters to one stat category. `compare` resolves athlete ids by name, listing candidates and exiting 2 on ambiguity. `boxscore` infers sport+league from the most recent cache hit; pass `--sport`/`--league` to skip inference.

## Auth Setup

**None required.** ESPN's public endpoints don't require an API key. The `auth` command exists for consistency but is a no-op.

Optional config:
- `ESPN_CONFIG` — override config file path
- `ESPN_BASE_URL` — override base URL (for proxies or mirrors)
- `NO_COLOR` — standard no-color env var

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`. Use `--select` for field cherry-picking, `--dry-run` to preview requests, `--no-cache` to bypass GET cache.

### Filtering output

`--select` accepts dotted paths to descend into nested responses; arrays traverse element-wise:

```bash
espn-pp-cli <command> --agent --select id,name
espn-pp-cli <command> --agent --select items.id,items.owner.name
```

Use this to narrow huge payloads to the fields you actually need — critical for deeply nested API responses.


### Response envelope

Data-layer commands wrap output in `{"meta": {...}, "results": <data>}`. Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's `live` or local. The `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a TTY; piped/agent consumers see pure JSON on stdout.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error |
| 3 | Not found (team, game, athlete) |
| 5 | API error |
| 7 | Rate limited |

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/espn/cmd/espn-pp-cli@latest
espn-pp-cli doctor
```

### MCP Server

```bash
go install github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/media-and-entertainment/espn/cmd/espn-pp-mcp@latest
claude mcp add espn-pp-mcp -- espn-pp-mcp
```

## Argument Parsing

Given `$ARGUMENTS`:

1. **Empty, `help`, or `--help`** → run `espn-pp-cli --help`
2. **`install`** → CLI; **`install mcp`** → MCP
3. **Anything else** → resolve `<sport> <league>` from user intent (e.g., "Lakers" → `basketball nba`), check `which espn-pp-cli` (offer install if missing), run with `--agent`.

## Agent Workflow Features

This CLI exposes three shared agent-workflow capabilities patched in from cli-printing-press PR #218.

### Named profiles

Persist a set of flags under a name and reuse them across invocations.

```bash
# Save the current non-default flags as a named profile
espn-pp-cli profile save <name>

# Use a profile — overlays its values onto any flag you don't set explicitly
espn-pp-cli --profile <name> <command>

# List / inspect / remove
espn-pp-cli profile list
espn-pp-cli profile show <name>
espn-pp-cli profile delete <name> --yes
```

Flag precedence: explicit flag > env var > profile > default.

### --deliver

Route command output to a sink other than stdout. Useful when an agent needs to hand a result to a file, a webhook, or another process without plumbing.

```bash
espn-pp-cli <command> --deliver file:/path/to/out.json
espn-pp-cli <command> --deliver webhook:https://hooks.example/in
```

File sinks write atomically (tmp + rename). Webhook sinks POST `application/json` (or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact` is set). Unknown schemes produce a structured refusal listing the supported set.

### feedback

Record in-band feedback about this CLI from the agent side of the loop. Local-only by default; safe to call without configuration.

```bash
espn-pp-cli feedback "what surprised you or tripped you up"
espn-pp-cli feedback list         # show local entries
espn-pp-cli feedback clear --yes  # wipe
```

Entries append to `~/.espn-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl` as JSON lines. When `ESPN_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set and either `--send` is passed or `ESPN_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`, the entry is also POSTed upstream (non-blocking — local write always succeeds).

## Execution Logic

The skill executes when its trigger fires (slash command, natural-language match, or direct invocation). It reads its references, applies its rules, and produces the documented outputs.

## Edge Cases

See the source skill's `references/` and `scripts/` folders for edge-case handling.

## Failure Handling

A skill failure surfaces as a tool error or a partial output; never a silent skip. Re-run with `--verbose` (where applicable) for diagnostics.
