## What it does & when to use

Full safety mode: destructive command warnings + directory-scoped edits. Combines /careful (warns before rm -rf, DROP TABLE, force-push, etc.) with /freeze (blocks edits outside a specified directory). Use for maximum safety when touching prod or debugging live systems. Use when asked to "guard mode", "full safety", "lock it down", or "maximum safety". (gstack)

## Triggers

- `guard mode`
- `full safety`
- `lock it down`
- `maximum safety`

## How it works

Workflow outline (sections of `SKILL.md`):

1. Setup
2. What's protected

## Components

Single-file skill — all instructions live in `SKILL.md`.

## Invoke

- Slash: `/guard`
- Or a natural-language request matching the triggers above.

---
_Source: `SKILL.md` in this directory._

## Execution Logic

The skill executes when its trigger fires (slash command, natural-language match, or direct invocation). It reads its references, applies its rules, and produces the documented outputs.

## Edge Cases

See the source skill's `references/` and `scripts/` folders for edge-case handling.

## Failure Handling

A skill failure surfaces as a tool error or a partial output; never a silent skip. Re-run with `--verbose` (where applicable) for diagnostics.

## Integration Notes

- Claude — invoked via the `Skill` tool with `skill: "guard"`.
- Codex — referenced from `AGENTS.md` if mirrored.
- Antigravity — referenced from the workspace agent rules if mirrored.
- HQ Project — listed on the landing page Skills section + post-login sidebar.
- MD Project (md.sgnk.ai) — file rendered from `Skills/Guard/workflow.md`.
- Obsidian — file rendered with frontmatter + tags.

## Usage Examples

Invoke via slash command or natural language matching the skill description.
